TripSync 🌍✈️
Smart, Agent-Based Travel Planning Platform

📝 Description
TripSync is a smart, web-based travel planning platform that unifies multiple key aspects of trip planning — including weather, routes, local events, and budget — into a single, user-friendly interface. It leverages intelligent agents (Weather, Maps, Events, Budget) that work collaboratively to generate an optimized, personalized itinerary for users.

Planning a trip no longer needs to mean juggling tabs, comparing data manually, or guessing travel costs — TripSync does it all for you.
